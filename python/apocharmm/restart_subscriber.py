    @brief Replaces a CHARMM-style restart file with current simulation state.

    Construction immediately creates or truncates the text output. During
    propagation, each scheduled native update rewrites the complete file with
    current context state and supported-integrator state. Box lengths and
    coordinates use angstroms, velocities use angstroms per AKMA time unit, and
    average temperature uses kelvin.

    Native updates support `CudaNoseHooverIntegrator`,
    `CudaLangevinPistonIntegrator`, and
    `CudaLangevinThermostatIntegrator`. Device-backed state is copied to host,
    and each transfer synchronizes the current CUDA device.

    The wrapper owns the concrete C handle. Its `subscriber_handle` property is
    a borrowed view into that handle. Use the object as a context manager or
    call `close()` through the wrapper; never destroy the borrowed view.

    @warning Unsubscribe before closing the wrapper. Closing invalidates the C
    base view even when the native integrator still retains the underlying C++
    subscriber.
    @warning Each update truncates the target before all sections are written. A
    native failure can replace a usable restart with a partial file.

        @brief Constructs and owns a native restart writer.

        `path` is converted with `os.fsencode()` through the package helper and
        copied by native construction. Accepted path objects are `str`, `bytes`,
        `os.PathLike[str]`, and `os.PathLike[bytes]`. The original Python object
        is retained in `_path`, but native file access does not borrow it.

        `report_frequency=None` selects the native default of 1000 steps. An
        explicit ordinary Python `int` must fit a signed 32-bit C `int` and be
        positive. Boolean values follow Python integer conversion: `True`
        becomes one and `False` is rejected by native validation.

        @param[in] path Filesystem path to create or truncate. It must encode to
        a nonempty native path; when the path has a nonempty parent path, that
        parent path must exist. Encoded bytes are passed as a null-terminated C
        string, so an embedded null byte truncates the path observed by native
        code.
        @param[in] report_frequency Optional positive, dimensionless number of
        propagated steps between restart replacements.
        @throws TypeError If `path` is not accepted by `os.fsencode()`, or an
        explicit frequency cannot be compared with integer bounds or converted
        by `ctypes.c_int`.
        @throws UnicodeEncodeError If the platform filesystem encoding cannot
        encode a string path.
        @throws ValueError If an explicit frequency is outside the signed
        32-bit C `int` range.
        @throws ApoCharmmError With native status
        `APO_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` if native construction rejects the path or
        frequency, or `APO_STATUS_RUNTIME_ERROR` if file opening, allocation,
        base-view conversion, or an unexpected native exception fails.
        @throws RuntimeError If a native function reports success but returns a
        null concrete or base handle.

        @post On success, the file has been created or truncated and this
        wrapper owns both the concrete handle and a live borrowed base view.
