construct a concrete subscriber rather than instantiate the base wrapper.

    @brief Provides the common Python interface to a native subscriber.

    The base wrapper does not create or own a native subscriber. Concrete
    subclasses own a concrete C handle and store a borrowed embedded base view
    in `_subscriber_handle`. That view is valid only until the concrete wrapper
    is closed.

    A `CudaIntegrator` retains each successfully subscribed Python wrapper in
    its `_subscribers` list and the native integrator retains the native C++
    subscriber. Unsubscribe before closing a concrete wrapper so its borrowed C
    view remains available to the native unsubscribe call.

    The wrapper provides no internal synchronization. Do not overlap closure,
    frequency changes, subscription, or propagation involving the same object
    from multiple threads.
