    @brief Writes periodic coordinate snapshots to a CHARMM DCD file.

    Construction immediately creates or truncates the binary output. During
    propagation, each scheduled native update writes single-precision X, Y, and
    Z coordinates in atom order and box lengths in angstroms. Charges are not
    written. Coordinate output copies device data to host and synchronizes the
    current CUDA device.

    The wrapper owns the concrete C handle. Its `subscriber_handle` property is
    a borrowed view into that handle. Use the object as a context manager or
    call `close()` exactly through the wrapper; never destroy the borrowed view.

    @warning Unsubscribe before closing the wrapper. Closing invalidates the C
    base view even when the native integrator still retains the underlying C++
    subscriber.
    @warning DCD updates are not transactional. A native write failure can leave
    a partial trajectory file after some dynamics steps have completed.

        @brief Constructs and owns a native DCD writer.

        `path` is converted with `os.fsencode()` through the package helper and
        copied by native construction. Accepted path objects are `str`, `bytes`,
        `os.PathLike[str]`, and `os.PathLike[bytes]`. The original Python object
        is retained in `_path`, but native file access does not borrow it.

        `report_frequency=None` selects the native default of 1000 steps. An
        explicit ordinary Python `int` must fit a signed 32-bit C `int` and be
        positive. Boolean values follow Python integer conversion: `True`
        becomes one and `False` is rejected by native validation.

        @param[in] path Filesystem path to create or truncate. It must encode to
        a nonempty native path; when the path has a nonempty parent path, that
        parent path must exist. Encoded bytes are passed as a null-terminated C
        string, so an embedded null byte truncates the path observed by native
        code.
        @param[in] report_frequency Optional positive, dimensionless number of
        propagated steps between DCD frames.
        @throws TypeError If `path` is not accepted by `os.fsencode()`, or an
        explicit frequency cannot be compared with integer bounds or converted
        by `ctypes.c_int`.
        @throws UnicodeEncodeError If the platform filesystem encoding cannot
        encode a string path.
        @throws ValueError If an explicit frequency is outside the signed
        32-bit C `int` range.
        @throws ApoCharmmError With native status
        `APO_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` if native construction rejects the path or
        frequency, or `APO_STATUS_RUNTIME_ERROR` if file opening, allocation,
        base-view conversion, or an unexpected native exception fails.
        @throws RuntimeError If a native function reports success but returns a
        null concrete or base handle.

        @post On success, the file has been created or truncated and this
        wrapper owns both the concrete handle and a live borrowed base view.
