@brief Provides the owning Python wrapper for atom-selection results.

`AtomSelection` exposes immutable count, index-list, and membership queries for
one native selection. User code normally obtains an instance from
`AtomSelector.select()` rather than constructing it from a raw handle.

    @brief Owns one immutable native atom-selection handle.

    Atom indices are zero-based, sorted in ascending order when returned as a
    list, and dimensionless. The wrapper stores no coordinates and performs no
    CUDA transfer or synchronization.

    The wrapper owns its C handle. `close()`, `destroy()`, context-manager exit,
    or finalization releases that handle; explicit closure is idempotent.
    Accessing any query after closure raises `RuntimeError`. Closing the selector
    or PSF that produced this object does not invalidate the selection.
