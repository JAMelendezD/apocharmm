 * @brief Represents an owned CHARMM-style restart writer in the C ABI.

 * A successful constructor returns a newly owned handle whose text output file
 * has already been created or truncated. Release it exactly once with
 * @ref apo_restart_subscriber_destroy. The handle can provide a borrowed
 * @ref apo_subscriber view for frequency changes and integrator attachment.
 *
 * Updates occur indirectly during integrator propagation and replace the file
 * with current context and supported-integrator state. Box lengths and
 * coordinates use angstroms, context velocities use angstroms per AKMA time
 * unit, and average temperature uses kelvin.
 *
 * Do not overlap destruction, subscription, propagation, or frequency changes
 * involving the same handle from multiple threads.
