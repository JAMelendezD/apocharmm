/**
 * @brief Represents a borrowed polymorphic CUDA-integrator view.
 *
 * A concrete integrator handle embeds this view. Obtain it with the concrete
 * `_as_cuda_integrator` function and keep the concrete owner alive for the
 * entire period of use. This type has no destroy function and must not be freed
 * by the caller.
 *
 * Functions in this header borrow the view for one call. Context attachment
 * retains the shared native context. Subscription retains the shared native
 * subscriber. The C pointers themselves are not retained.
 *
 * Status-returning calls clear the calling thread's previous diagnostic at
 * entry. On failure, call @ref apo_last_error immediately on the same thread.
 * Its returned pointer is borrowed and is invalidated by the next
 * diagnostic-changing C ABI call on that thread.
 *
 * The view provides no internal synchronization. Do not overlap propagation,
 * restart loading, mutation, subscription, unsubscription, or destruction
 * involving the same native integrator or context from multiple threads.
 *
