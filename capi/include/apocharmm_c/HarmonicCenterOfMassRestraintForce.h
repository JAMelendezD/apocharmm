/**
 * @brief Represents an owned harmonic center-of-mass restraint in the C ABI.
 *
 * A successful @ref apo_harmonic_center_of_mass_restraint_force_create call
 * returns one newly owned handle. Release it with
 * @ref apo_harmonic_center_of_mass_restraint_force_destroy. Configuration
 * functions borrow a live handle for one call and copy all supplied selections
 * and arrays.
 *
 * A successful manager subscription retains an independent native shared owner
 * of the restraint, CUDA stream holder, force array, and energy-virial object.
 * Destroying this C handle therefore does not remove an existing subscription.
 * Unsubscribe before destruction when later explicit unsubscription is needed.
 *
 * The C ABI exposes configuration and manager subscription, not direct kernel
 * invocation or output access. Use `ForceManager` or `CharmmContext` to drive
 * force, energy, and virial calculation.
 *
 * A non-NULL pointer must designate a live handle created by apoCHARMM. Passing
 * a dangling, already-destroyed, or foreign pointer has undefined behavior.
 * The handle and native object provide no internal synchronization; callers
 * must serialize mutation, manager operations, calculation, and destruction.
 *
 * Every status-returning function clears the calling thread's previous
 * diagnostic at entry. Success leaves it empty. On failure, call
 * @ref apo_last_error on the same thread. Its borrowed pointer remains valid
 * only until another diagnostic-changing C ABI call on that thread.
