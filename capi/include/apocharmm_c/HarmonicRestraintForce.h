/**
 * @brief Represents an owned absolute harmonic restraint in the C ABI.
 *
 * A successful @ref apo_harmonic_restraint_force_create call returns one newly
 * owned handle. The caller releases that handle with
 * @ref apo_harmonic_restraint_force_destroy. Configuration functions borrow a
 * live handle for one call and copy all supplied selections and arrays.
 *
 * A successful force-manager subscription retains an independent native shared
 * owner of the restraint, stream, force array, and energy object. Destroying
 * this C handle does not unsubscribe that retained native object. Unsubscribe
 * before destruction when the caller will need to remove the force explicitly.
 *
 * The C ABI exposes configuration and subscription but no direct force-kernel
 * invocation or output access. Use `ForceManager` or `CharmmContext` to drive
 * calculation.
 *
 * A non-NULL pointer must designate a live handle created by apoCHARMM.
 * Passing a dangling, already-destroyed, or foreign pointer has undefined
 * behavior. The handle and associated native object provide no internal
 * synchronization; callers must serialize mutation, subscription, calculation,
 * unsubscription, and destruction.
 *
 * Every status-returning function clears the calling thread's previous
 * diagnostic at entry. Success leaves it empty. On failure, call
 * @ref apo_last_error immediately on the same thread; its borrowed pointer is
 * valid only until another diagnostic-changing C ABI call on that thread.
 *
