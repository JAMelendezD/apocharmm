/**
 * @brief Provides shared lifecycle and scheduling for CUDA integrators.
 *
 * `CudaIntegrator` owns common trajectory counters, per-atom displacement
 * storage, CUDA streams, optional holonomic-constraint state, subscriber
 * scheduling, and a retained @ref CharmmContext. Concrete integrators implement
 * the protected initialization, restart, and one-step hooks.
 *
 * The class is a polymorphic base but is not abstract. Direct calls to the
 * base implementation's initialization, restart, descriptor, or one-step hooks
 * throw `ApoCharmmErrorCode::NotImplemented`.
 *
 * Context attachment and propagation are not thread-safe. Serialize all
 * operations involving one integrator, its context, or its subscribers.
 *
 * @warning The current class does not declare copy or move operations. Treat
 * native integrator objects as non-copyable because their resource-owning
 * members do not have safe implicit-copy semantics.
