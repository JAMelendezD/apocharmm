/**
 * @brief Defines the scheduled output interface used by CUDA integrators.
 *
 * A subscriber owns one host output stream, stores a positive report frequency,
 * and can retain shared ownership of one @ref CharmmContext and one
 * `CudaIntegrator`. `CudaIntegrator::subscribe()` attaches those collaborators,
 * retains the subscriber, and snapshots its current report frequency. During
 * propagation, the integrator invokes @ref update synchronously on the calling
 * thread after each matching dynamics step.
 *
 * The base class is abstract. It is not copyable because it owns a
 * `std::fstream`, and its user-declared destructor prevents implicit move
 * operations. The class performs no internal locking; callers must serialize
 * stream access, attachment, frequency changes, updates, and destruction.
 *
 * @warning A subscribed integrator and subscriber retain each other through
 * `std::shared_ptr`. Call `CudaIntegrator::unsubscribe()` before releasing the
 * final external owners.
 * @warning Configure the file name and report frequency before subscription.
 * The integrator caches the frequency and does not observe later changes.
 *
 * @see subscriber
